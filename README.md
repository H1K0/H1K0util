# X10D (_extend_) your CMD! ![For any OS where command shell exists](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-XP+-brightgreen.svg)

Well, just a set of some commands to extend the functionality of your command shell.

## Installing

Just add the directory with the [`xtd.exe`](xtd.exe) to the PATH. In future I plan to make the `setup.exe` which will do this automatically.

## Usage

```
$ xtd [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  binv  Invert FILE(S) bitwisely.
  now   What's time?
```
